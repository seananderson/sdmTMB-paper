abstract = {Bayesian spatial models are widely used to analyse data that arise in scientific disciplines such as health, ecology, and the environment. Traditionally, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been used to fit these type of models. However, these are highly computationally intensive methods that present a wide range of issues in terms of convergence and can become infeasible in big data problems. The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method is a computational less-intensive alternative to MCMC that allows us to perform approximate Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models such as generalised linear mixed models and spatial and spatio-temporal models. This approach can be used in combination with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to analyse geostatistical data that have been collected at particular sites to predict the spatial process underlying the data as well as to assess the effect of covariates and model other sources of variability. Here we demonstrate how to fit a Bayesian spatial model using the INLA and SPDE approaches applied to freely available data of malaria prevalence and risk factors in Mozambique. We show how to fit and interpret the model to predict malaria risk and assess the effect of covariates using the R-INLA package, and provide the R code necessary to reproduce the results or to use it in other spatial applications.}

abstract = {In this paper we explore the use of the Integrated Laplace Approximation (INLA) for Bayesian inference in some widely used models in Spatial Econometrics. Bayesian inference often relies on computationally intensive simulation methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. When only marginal inference is needed, INLA provides a fast and accurate estimate of the posterior marginals of the parameters in the model. Furthermore, we have compared the results provided by these models to those obtained with a more general class of Generalised Linear Models with random effects. In these models, spatial autocorrelation is modelled by means of correlated Gaussian random effects. We also discuss a procedure to extend the class of models that the R-INLA software can fit. This approach is based on conditioning on one or more parameters so that the resulting models can be fitted with R-INLA across sets of values of the fixed parameters. The posterior marginals of these parameters of interest are then obtained by combining the marginal likelihoods (which are conditioned on the values of the parameters fixed) of the fitted models and a prior on these parameters. This approach can also be used to fit even more general models. Finally, we discuss the use of all these models on two datasets based on median housing prices for census tracts in Boston and the probability of business re-opening in New Orleans in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina.}

    abstract = "{We study the application of Bayesian spatial modelling to seismic tomography, a geophysical, high dimensional, linearized inverse problem that infers the three-dimensional structure of the Earth’s interior. We develop a spatial dependence model of seismic wave velocity variations in the Earth’s mantle based on a Gaussian Matérn field approximation. Using the theory of stochastic partial differential equations, this model quantifies the uncertainties in the parameter space by means of the integrated nested Laplace approximation. In resolution tests using simulated data and in inversions using real data, our model matches the performance of conventional deterministic optimization approaches in retrieving three-dimensional structure of the Earth’s mantle. In addition it delivers estimates of the full parameter covariance matrix. Our model substantially improves on previous work relying on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in terms of statistical misfits and computing time.}",
