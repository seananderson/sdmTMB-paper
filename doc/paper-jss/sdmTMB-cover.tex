\opening{Dear Editorial Board,}

Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication in the Journal of Statistical Software. We have made all the requested editorial changes as described in the file \texttt{formatting-response.pdf}.

Our original cover letter follows:

Our manuscript introduces the \proglang{R} package \pkg{sdmTMB} for fitting a broad class of generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs) that include spatial or spatiotemporal random fields. Such models are useful across a wide array of disciplines.

We believe that \pkg{sdmTMB} represents a major advance in terms of functionality, accessibility, and speed for fitting the broad class of SPDE (stochastic partial differential equation)-based GLMMs to spatial or spatiotemporal data.

Functionality: This package represents a spatial analog of the \pkg{glmmTMB} \proglang{R} package, with additional features beyond standard random fields (penalized smoothers as in \pkg{mgcv}, priors as in \pkg{INLA}, threshold/breakpoint models), spatial anisotropy (directionally dependent spatial correlation), and methods for model comparison (cross-validation, stacking).

Accessibility: \pkg{sdmTMB} provides a more usable interface than alternatives, particularly for users who may be familiar with the syntax found in \proglang{R}'s \texttt{glm()}, \pkg{glmmTMB}, \pkg{lme4}, or \pkg{mgcv} packages. Furthermore, existing packages such as \pkg{INLA} or \pkg{inlabru} are fundamentally Bayesian and require users to deal with the complexity of priors. While \pkg{sdmTMB} can incorporate priors and extend to full Bayesian inference via \pkg{Stan}, by default estimation is done using the simplicity and speed of maximum likelihood.

Speed: The package combines the SPDE approximation with estimation in the \pkg{TMB} \proglang{R} package for computational efficiency. Across our comparisons, \pkg{sdmTMB} was 7--30 times faster than the \pkg{INLA} or \pkg{inlabru} packages---the software with the most similar capabilities for this class of models.

As evidence of its utility, there are already \href{https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB/wiki/Publications-using-sdmTMB}{19 published preprints, papers, or reports} using \pkg{sdmTMB}, six funded research grants, an ever-growing number of ongoing research projects, and international workshops that in total have been attended by $>$200 participants.

% We think the readers of JSS would be the ideal audience for our manuscf

JSS would be the ideal outlet to provide a citable resource for \pkg{sdmTMB} and to introduce the package to a wider audience. \pkg{sdmTMB} is an open-source \proglang{R} package \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sdmTMB}{published on CRAN}. Our code is fully reproducible and included with our submission. We have posted a preprint version of our manuscript \href{https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.24.485545}{on bioRxiv}.  We have included a list of potential reviewers on the following page should it be helpful. We look forward to constructive feedback from your reviewers and editors.
