# pcod

- add in offset
- model catch
- compare families? options:
  - tweedie
  - delta-gamma
  - delta-lognormal
  - delta-poisson-link-gamma
  - delta-poisson-link-lognormal
  - delta_gamma_mix
  - delta_lognormal_mix

- within a family:
  - field structures?
  - anisotropy?
  - time_varying?
  - share_range?

- summary
- AIC
- prediction
- show index?

- maybe compare 2 with cross validation?

# count data hook and line survey?

- poisson, poisson + (1 | obs_id), negbin1, negbin2, delta_truncated_negbin2
- censored poisson!! with + (1 | obs_id)

# owls SVC

- SVC concept and math
- simulating from MVN...?

# other things to possibly demo

- update() [yes?]
- IID random intercepts [maybe?]
- time_varying formula + type? [would be nice?]
- spatial varying formula [yes]
- priors [probably not?]
- cross validation? [probably not? although I'm increasingly thinking this is important]
- spatiotemporal field structures [yes?]
- share_range? [no?]
- anisotropy? [yes?]
- barrier [no?]
