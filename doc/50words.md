<!-- A British Ecological Society journal, Methods in Ecology and Evolution (MEE) promotes the development of new methods in ecology and evolution, and facilitates their dissemination and uptake by the research community. MEE brings together papers from previously disparate sub-disciplines to provide a single forum for tracking methodological developments in all areas. -->

<!-- MEE publishes methodological papers in any area of ecology and evolution, including: -->

<!-- Phylogenetic analysis -->
<!-- Statistical methods -->
<!-- Conservation & management -->
<!-- Theoretical methods -->
<!-- Practical methods, including lab and field -->
<!-- This list is not exhaustive, and we welcome enquiries about possible submissions. Methods are defined in the widest terms and may be analytical, practical or conceptual. -->

<!-- A primary aim of the journal is to maximise the uptake of techniques by the community. We recognise that a major stumbling block in the uptake and application of new methods is the accessibility of methods. For example, users may need computer code, example applications or demonstrations of methods. -->

We introduce sdmTMB, an R package designed to make a powerful and useful approach to modelling spatial or spatiotemporal ecological data (GLMMs with Gaussian random fields) accessible to applied ecologists. sdmTMB is also faster than alternatives and provides a combination of functionality not available elsewhere.
